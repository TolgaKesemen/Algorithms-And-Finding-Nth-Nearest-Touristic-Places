# Algorithms-And-Finding-Nth-Nearest-Touristic-Places
It contains two parts. In part1, there is 5 different sort algorithms. Program evaluates their execution times for random N numbers. In part2, for a randomly generated coordinate it finds the nearest touristic places.It sorts them based upon location fee and distance.
This project was an assignment in 'BBM204-Software Laboratory II' course at HACETTEPE UNIVERSITY. You can find the expirement sheet and the report of experiment in the project directory.
